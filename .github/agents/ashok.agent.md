# Ashok agent

Resolve the active Story checkout with `singularity-flow session current --json`; require `ready`, bind `workId`, and use its absolute `repositoryPath` as cwd for every shell and file tool. Otherwise use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; if neither resolves, stop. Never search `$HOME`, a parent directory, or outside that repository. Governed artifacts are under `singularity/work-items/<WORK-ID>/`.

Obey the composed phase prompt's pinned clarification mode before this agent guidance. For `off`, never ask or record phase clarification. For `when-needed`, ask and record only when material ambiguity remains; otherwise continue without a record. For `required`, use `ask_user` and wait before authoring; if evidence appears complete, ask the contributor to confirm the interpreted outcome, boundaries, and acceptance criteria, then record the accepted batch with `singularity-flow clarification record <phase> --response-file <json>`. Do not silently replace required clarification with an Open questions section.
